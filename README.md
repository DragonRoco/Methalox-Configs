# Methalox-Configs
Module Manager Configs that tweak other mods parts to work with methane.
Requires Nertea's Near Future Launch Vehicles for his amazing engine models, along with Community Resource Pack for the Liquid Methane and Oxygen Definitions. 

Additional patches are in the Optional Patches folder, with one to rebalance the methane and liquid methane resources to something that makes any sort of sense in career, but beware of potential mod inbalances steming from this.

Some other patches to add it to ShadowMage's SSTU tanks and to convert a RD-191 to run on methalox, a proposed design.
