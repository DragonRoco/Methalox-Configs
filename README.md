Module Manager Configs that tweak other mods parts to work with methane.
Requires Nertea's Near Future Launch Vehicles for his amazing engine models.
Additional patches are in the Optional Patches folder, with one to rebalance the methane and liquid methane resources to something that makes any sort of sense in Career, along with one to add the fuel mix to SSTU's tanks.
